print("a: " + a)

# purpose of this is code to make you think how you can switch around the values within a & b which in this example would require introducing a third to 
#capture the value of a using c. Variables can be changed from one line to another ie: num = 1 then later in code block num = 3 
#the value of num is now 3 but at first the value of num was = 1
